        Our platform is designed to reward the best data labelers with higher pay. We use a special system, similar to ELO ratings in games, which measures how good you are at labeling data based on accuracy and performance. When you sign up and start labeling, your score changes based on how well you do, directly affecting how much you earn. This system makes sure that only the best labelers get the top rewards, keeping our data quality really high. 
        <p>Each time you work, your score updates in real-time, so you always know where you stand. Our goal is to make sure we have the best quality data by making sure the people who do the best work are rewarded the most. Itâ€™s all about matching your skill and hard work with better pay. The higher your ranking, the higher the pay.</p>

        <div className='section-p'>
        <p>Open-source AI models are key to future innovations. While many are working on these models, there's a big issue: the data they're trained on, especially how it's labeled or annotated, isn't always visible to everyone. These details are crucial for making AI work well and fairl. Our goal is to promote truly open AI. This means making sure everyone can see and use the data and technologies behind AI, ensuring it's fair and accessible for all creators and users.</p>
        <p> We're focused on preventing a future where only a few have control over AI technologies. By pushing for openness, transparency, and fairness in AI, we're working towards a future where AI benefits everyone equally. This approach encourages shared progress and innovation, making sure AI advancements are available to all, without fear of any single entity dominating the field.</p>
